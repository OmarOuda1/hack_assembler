# The Hack assembler

This was project 6 in the NAND To Tetris course the objective was building an assembler for the hack assembly language using any programming language you like, I chose to write it in C to further my skills in C.

## Usage

Just run the executable with the name of the file as an inline parameter.

```shell
hack <file.asm>
```

The program will output the binary data as a text file with the same name, but using the **<u>.hack</u>** extension.
